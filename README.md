# Description

The model uses pytorch lightning module to create Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) which has been used for data augmentation. The Generator and the discriminator train each other till the point where generator gets pretty good at generating real like images.  

The model currently is trained on two datasets â€“ MNIST and FashionMNIST. The generator can create new images from random values which can fool the discriminator. Since the images can fool the discriminator, they can be assumed to be like the ones seen in the training data and hence can be used to beef up the training dataset.
